# Running the Project Using Docker

To run the project with Docker, follow these steps:

1. **Set up the Environment**:

    - Ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system.
    - If not, refer to the official [Docker Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
      and [Docker Compose Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

2. **Start the Services**:

    - Use the provided `docker-compose.yml` file to spin up the necessary containers (backend and MongoDB).
    - Run the following command in the directory where the `docker-compose.yml` file is located:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

3. **Access the Application**:

    - The backend service will be accessible at **http://localhost:3000**.
    - MongoDB is configured as a dependency and will automatically be linked to the backend container.

4. **Environment Variables**:

    - The `MONGODB_URL` environment variable is set to `mongodb://user:password@mongodb:27017/`.
    - The backend server will run on port `3000`, mapped to the host machine.

5. **Persistent Data**:

    - The MongoDB data is stored in a Docker volume (`mongodb`) to ensure persistence across restarts.

6. **Stop the Services**:

    - To stop the running containers, press `CTRL+C` or run:

   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   ```

7. **Restart Containers**:

    - If youâ€™ve made changes to the code or configuration, restart the containers using:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

8. **Health Check**:

    - The MongoDB service includes a `healthcheck` to verify that the database
      is ready and responsive before the backend service starts.
    - You can verify container health by running:

   ```bash
   docker ps
   ```

This setup ensures the backend and MongoDB are easily started, linked, and maintained using Docker Compose.
